### GitFlow workflow
This project uses GitFlow. This means that we don't commit into `main` branch. We have a `development` branch, so we create `feature` branches and commit in them. When the feature is complete, we merge `feature` branch with `development` branch using a pull request. After that, when a major and stable version is ready, we create a pull request to merge `development` into `main`
