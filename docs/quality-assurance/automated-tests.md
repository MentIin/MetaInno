# Unit testing
Unit tests are performed in-engine using Unity Test Framework.

The folder with unit tests can be found [here](/Assets/_Project/CodeBase/Tests).
# Integration testing
Our project doesn't integrate any third-party services. And the self-made services/systems are too shallow to be tested using integration tests. We use only unit testing.
