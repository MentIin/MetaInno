# Usefulness and Transition Report

**Q: Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?**

- A: The project isn’t finished, it is not a complete product yet. It is currently in the prototype phase.

**Q: Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not,
why not?**

- A: The game is currently not used as a product because it is not polished yet. We first need to release the polished version of the project for tourists and then plan a global release.

**Q: Has the customer deployed the product on their side?**

- A: Yes, there is an Itch io page with the game.

**Q: What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?**

- A: Polish the camera, characters, and movement. The map requires further improvements. Core mechanics still need to be improved. We need to add more interactions between characters. And also add more minigames.

**Q: What are the customer’s plans for the product after its delivery? Are
they going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue
collaborating with the team and on what conditions?**

- A: The most motivated part of the team can participate in further development of the project. The customer wants to polish the project and release it to the tourists.

**Q: How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after the final delivery?**

- A: We can complete the core mechanics and polish the map.

# Readme Feedback
**Q: Is everything clear? What can be improved?**

- A: Everything is very clear, the docs folder is very rich: it provides insides on the architecture and deployment. Overall readme quality is very good.

**Q: Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?**

- A: Yes, launch/deploy instructions are pretty clear.

**Q: What two other sections the customer would like to be
included in the ReadMe?**

- A: It would be better if there was a Game Design Document section that contained the link to russian and english versions of GDD.
You can also add a Demo section that contains a link to the folder with demo video and in-game screenshots.
