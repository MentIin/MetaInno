# Continuous Integration
For CI we use Super Linter - it lints our C# code on every commit and pull request into `main` and `development`.
GitHub Actions can be found [here](https://github.com/MentIin/MetaInno/actions).
There aren't any other CI tools available for Unity (besides unit tests that are checked in-egine).
